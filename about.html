          <h1>About this project</h1>

          <p>This website presents a curated collection of cultural artifacts that explore the legacy of military dictatorships in South America. The project investigates how these authoritarian regimes shaped democratic trajectories across the continent, leaving behind complex memories, resistance, and silences.</p>

          <p>Each map is paired with media — songs, films, books, and artistic works — that either emerged during the dictatorships or reflect upon them from a later perspective. These materials invite the viewer to understand not only the political history but also the emotional and cultural responses that continue to resonate today.</p>

          <p>Together, the spatial and cultural elements offer an interdisciplinary perspective on censorship, political violence, and the power of memory in shaping democratic consciousness.</p>
